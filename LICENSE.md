 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't play the dick.

    Playing the dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

    1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy the original work/works and change the name.  
    1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY [being a dick](https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad).  
    1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 tell the original work's creator(s) and indicate the source of the original work. Only the people who play the dick would make loads off this work and not tell the original work's creator(s) or buy the original work's creator(s) a liter of coffee.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a MONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back or submit a bug report.

 4.This license does not contain any legal benefits. Please do not use it as evidence in court like a person who only like to play the dick.
